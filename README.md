# django-rango
This repository houses the source code for a web-site that is produced with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). As I am figuring out how to use Django, the development of the web-site follows a guide called [Tango with Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/).

Although the guide comes with a [code repository](https://github.com/leifos/tango_with_django) for the source code of the web-site, I am coding the web-site by hand because I want to practise how to program in Python.

## How to run

1. `git-clone` this repo into your local directory.
2. run `python manage.py runserver` in the directory that has **manage.py**
